        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>Peel & cut the squash into even sized pieces & place onto a tray. Place the squash into the DS59N on steam mode for 35-40 minutes or until mashable. </p>

            <p>Once cooked, transfer the squash to a mixing bowl & mash the flesh until smooth then add the flour, garlic, onion, vegan butter, chilli flakes & soy sauce, then mix well. </p>
        
            <p>Lightly flour your hands and a baking tray then for the mix into patties. </p>
        
            <p>Place the patties into the fridge to firm up for 20 minutes. Meanwhile add the panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with the sesame seeds. </p>
        
            <p>In another bowl mix together the plain flour with the water & sesame oil – to make a loose batter. In a 3rd bowl add a little additional plain flour for dusting. </p>
        
            <p>When the patties have firmed up slightly, carefully dip them first into the plain flour then into the batter, followed by the panko. Making sure they’re well coated. </p>
        
            <p>Once you’ve coated all the croquettes, place them onto a lined baking tray & drizzle over a little oil. Place them into the DS59N set to oven mode at 180 degrees C. </p>
        
            <p>Allow them to cook for 20—25 minutes or until golden. </p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile prepare your garnish & make the curry Mayo by simply mixing together the mayo, curry powder & tonkotsu. </p>
        
            <p>When the croquettes are cooked, build your burgers with lots of lovely fresh salad, pickles & mayo. </p>
