        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>In a large mixing bowl gentle mix together mashed potato with the plain flour, olive oil, salt & pepper until it forms a dough. </p>

        <p>Knead the dough on your lightly floured work surface for 4-5 minutes until it resembles a slightly softer pasta dough. </p>
        
        <p>Cut the dough into 4 pieces then roll each piece into a long sausage shape around 2cm in diameter. Cut the dough up into 2cm chunks. </p>
        
        <p>You can know choose to leave the gnocchi in their natural shape or get creative. See the above video tutorial to see how it is done.</p>
        
        <p>Before cooking the gnocchi in boiling salted water, get your sauce cooking. Pre heat a non stick frying pan over a medium heat with a little oil.</p>
        
        <p>Saut√© the mushrooms, onion & garlic for 4-5 minutes with the chilli & dried tarragon. </p>
        
        <p>When the mushrooms are golden, carefully deglaze the pan with the brandy. When the alcohol has cooked off, add the salt, pepper & vegan cream. </p>
        
        <p>Let the sauce bubble away and thicken up for 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile place your gnocchi into a saucepan of boiling water to cook for 3-4 minutes. When the gnocchi is springy to the touch, transfer it to the sauce. Alternatively you can pan fry the gnocchi after being boiled to get it lovely, golden & crisp before adding it to the sauce. </p>
        
        <p>Coat the gnocchi in the sauce the serve, garnished with tarragon & cress. </p>
